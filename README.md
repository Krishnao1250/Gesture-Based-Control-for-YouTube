# Gesture-Based-Control-for-YouTube
Developed a Python-based gesture recognition system using mediapipe to control YouTube playback. Hand landmarks were detected in real-time, enabling gestures for pause, play, and speed adjustment. Implemented data logging to store landmarks, gestures, and timestamps in a CSV file for analysis.
